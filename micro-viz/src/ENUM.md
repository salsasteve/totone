Excellent question. After making a strong case for traits, it's crucial to understand that enums are not bad—they are just a different tool for a different job. Choosing between them is a key part of good software design.

Enums are the better choice when you have a **fixed, known, and complete set of variations**, and you want the compiler to guarantee that you have handled every single possibility.

Here are the prime situations where an enum is the superior choice over a trait.

---

### 1. When the Set of Options is Truly Fixed and Complete

This is the most important reason. If you can confidently say, "This is the full list, and it will never, ever change," an enum is perfect.

* **Examples:**
    * Days of the week: `enum Day { Sunday, Monday, ... }`
    * Primary colors: `enum PrimaryColor { Red, Green, Blue }`
    * Directions on a compass: `enum Direction { North, South, East, West }`
    * Your `BinSummaryStrategy`: `enum BinSummaryStrategy { Average, Max }`. The choice between "average" and "max" is a fundamental, closed decision. You're unlikely to add dozens of new strategies here, so an enum is simple and effective.

In these cases, the list is logically complete. Adding a "new" day of the week doesn't make sense. A trait would be massive overkill and would incorrectly imply that the set is extensible.

### 2. Modeling State Machines

Enums are the absolute best way to model a system that can only be in one of a few specific states at any given time.

* **Example: A network connection.**
    ```rust
    enum NetworkState {
        Disconnected,
        Connecting,
        Connected,
        Error(String),
    }
    ```
    A connection can't be "Connected" and "Disconnected" at the same time. The enum perfectly captures this. The compiler will force you to handle all possible states when you write logic to manage the connection, which is a huge safety feature.

### 3. When You *Want* to Force All Cases to Be Handled

The fact that `match` statements must be exhaustive is a powerful feature. When you use an enum, the Rust compiler is your partner, ensuring you don't forget a case.

* **Example: Handling a fixed set of errors.**
    ```rust
    enum FileError {
        NotFound,
        PermissionDenied,
        IsADirectory,
    }

    fn handle_error(e: FileError) {
        match e {
            FileError::NotFound => println!("File not found, creating it."),
            FileError::PermissionDenied => println!("Permission denied, aborting."),
            FileError::IsADirectory => println!("Cannot open a directory."),
        }
    }
    ```
    If you later add `FileError::DiskFull`, the compiler will show an error at this `match` statement, forcing you to decide how to handle the new error case. With a trait, you couldn't do this; you wouldn't have a single place to view and handle all possible "error workers."

### 4. When the Logic for Each Variant is Simple

If the code to handle each case is small and self-contained, creating entire new structs and files for a trait implementation is unnecessary boilerplate. The `match` statement is far more direct and readable.

Your original `ColorMode` enum was a borderline case. Early on, when the logic for each color was simple, it was a perfectly reasonable choice. It only became a candidate for a trait once the logic grew and the desire for user-extensibility became a priority.

### **A Simple Litmus Test**

To decide between an enum and a trait, ask yourself this one question:

**"Do I want to allow someone else (including my future self) to add new behaviors later, without changing this central piece of code?"**

* If **YES** → Use a **Trait**.
    * *Examples:* Renderers, Animation Styles, Data Processors, Band Aggregators. These are creative behaviors you want to be able to add freely. This is the **Open for Extension** world.

* If **NO**, because the list is fixed and I want to control it → Use an **Enum**.
    * *Examples:* `NetworkState`, `Direction`, `FileError`. The behavior is defined by a closed, known set of possibilities. This is the **Closed for Modification** world.

In short, enums are for when you know all the answers, and traits are for when you want to leave room for questions you haven't thought of yet.
